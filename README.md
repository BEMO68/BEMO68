BEMO68.    Hello to all and for what it's worth I know absolutely nothing about writing code simply came here trying to solve the error code for Bluetooth 133 and I'm looking to learn anything I can about the Bluetooth and the evolution of it so if anyone cares to add their two cents worth in a kind way I would certainly welcome that and if you feel like being a jerk and saying something stupid to my Gmail you can do that too because I'll just hit trash can and you'll be down in the bottom of it. Thank you very much
